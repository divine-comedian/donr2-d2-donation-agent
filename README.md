# DONR2-D2 DONATION AGENT PROTOTYPE 

## The Problem: 

Funding Public Goods is an overwhelming task, current mechanisms arenâ€™t capable of scaling to meet the needs of our world.

- Projects struggle to raise consistent support, often diverting energy toward marketing instead of impact.

- Traditional donation models are inefficient, opaque, and under-incentivized.

- Donors lack clarity and confidence on which organizations can create the most impact.

## DONR2-D2 aims to solve this by: 

- Automatically analyzing projects looking for funding and determining which are high quality and impactful 

- Distributing funding in its wallet to the determined high quality projects

- Highlighting a project's excellence through social


# Distribution Strategy: 

DONR2-D2 will be piloted as a project on Giveth

Users can donate funds to its wallet on Polygon just like any regular Giveth project. 

DONR2-D2 will re-distribute those funds on Polygon to the top projects on Giveth, based on it's assessment.
